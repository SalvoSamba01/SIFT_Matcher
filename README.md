# SIFT_Matcher

This project uses the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm for object recognition. The program takes a reference image of an object, preferably on a white background, and detects the presence of the same object in the video stream from the PC's webcam. When the object is detected in the video, the program prints "Object found" on the screen.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Take a photo of the object to recognize, preferably on a white background, and put this image into the project folder with the name "target.jpeg" (you'll find an example in the project folder).
4. Point the webcam towards the object to be detected
